# keil-dark-theme-persian-nights

## General Information
Here you will find a dark theme for Keil µVision (tested on V5.37.0.0). I found some other dark themes that did not the support the Assembly editor (only C/C++). So I decided to create a theme for both editors. It currently supports following editors/windows:
+ Asm Editor Files
+ C/C++ Editor Files
+ Other/Editor Text Files
  
I am an Iranian/a Persian computer science student and made this theme over the night. Therefore, I decided to call it "Persian Nights".

I used everywhere the "Consolas" font (size 10 as default). Most (not all) of the colors used are from following palettes:
